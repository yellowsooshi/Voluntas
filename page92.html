  <h1>Voluntas</h1>
  <div>
    <p>This is kind of it, as I'm not much of a professional to serve you further.</p>
    <p>I hoped that I had helped you get through the things you were facing!</p>
    <p>It's awsome to see you going through the time looking for help!</p>
    <p>If you're still struggling, try to be brave and ask for professional help!</p>
    <br>
    <p>If you still need some advices, just remember that people DO get through this.</p>
    <p>It's okay to take breaks here and there. When your body needs rest, give your body rest!</p>
    <p>Get the help you need now so that you won't make any regrets in the future!</p>
    <p>And remember to do things that future you will thank you for doing!</p>
